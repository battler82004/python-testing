I created this program after watching Tom Scott's video about the longest word that can be displayed via a seven segment display. I used the same disallowed
letters as him, but I used a different a word bank with 479k English words in it (which I edited slightly). I got this list of English words from: 
https://github.com/dwyl/english-words. To use this program, you may need to mess around with the location / name for the list of words. For me personally, I
had to first create a txt file in Python, use the search bar to find it buried in some random folder, then open it and copy the list of words from the txt
file in this folder to that file.
